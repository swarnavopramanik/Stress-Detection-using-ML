# Stress Detection with Machine Learning

Stress, anxiety, and depression are threatening the mental health of people. Every person has a reason for having a stressful life. People often share their feelings on social media platforms like on Instagram in the form of posts and stories, and on Reddit in the form of asking for suggestions about their life on subreddits. In the past few years, many content creators have come forward to create content to help people with their mental health. Many organizations can use stress detection to find which social media users are stressed to help them quickly. So if you want to learn how to use machine learning to detect stress on social media posts, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through the task of stress detection with machine learning using Python.

Stress detection is a challenging task, as there are so many words that can be used by people on their posts that can show whether a person is having psychological stress or not. While looking for datasets that I can use to train a machine learning model for stress detection, I found a dataset on Kaggle with 116 columns. We only need to use the text and label column for this task.

The dataset I am using for this task contains data posted on subreddits related to mental health. This dataset contains various mental health problems shared by people about their life. Fortunately, this dataset is labelled as 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no stress and 1 indicates stress. So in the section below, I will take you through the task of stress detection in social media posts using Python.

# Abstract
In today's competitive and rival world, stress has emerged to be an integral part of every person's life which affects an individual directly or indirectly in many ways. The COVID-19 pandemic even glorified the importance and cruciality of managing stress, anxiety and depression as these created a massive impact on the economy, education, healthcare, business areas and other aspects of society in every possible manner. This study determines to find all the feasible contributing factors to stress, anxiety and depression which influence individuals coming from vivid occupational backgrounds due to personal, work-related, psychological and interpersonal reasons. Our research aims to define and describe the impact of the rise in technology and the COVID-19 pandemic on the stress levels of an individual. It includes variously supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms in detecting stress efficiently and effectively among a huge population. The objective of this paper is to make those millions of people aware of the early detection and treatment of stress before it becomes life-threatening to them. The paper finally throws light on how stress-related research will help policymakers in the education field and general industry sector to rebuild the policies on stress and countermeasures to avoid stress.
